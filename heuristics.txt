# Heuristic --> Rule out exponential algorithms with a decent amount of constraints 
# Heuristic 2: 
	# There always has to be one element not in the constraint list at all 
	# We can take this element and put it in the middle 
# There is never one unique answer --> We can always swap beginning and end
