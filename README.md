# cs170


### Running the program 
* ``` cd cs170```
* ``` ipython3```
* ``` %run exponential_solution.py``` 
* ```cd phase2_inputs\ 2``` 

For both the inputs35 and inputs50 directory issue the following commands (Note inputs 20 has already been optimally solved) 
* ```cd <directory> ``` 
* ```supervisor(<output_filename>) --> Note the output filename should be output_<35 or 50>_<your name>.out ```
Supervisor iterates through every file in the directory and runs Markov Solver writing the solution to the output file you specify.
